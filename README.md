# shoppingbasket
Shopping basket Java backend

Based on the shopping basket test. This was created with IntelliJ IDEA community edition. 

A model has been created for the following:
Add a an item to the basket
Add the same item to a basket
Get the contents of the basket
Get to total cost for the basket (an item should have a unit cost)

Along with Unit tests where possible.

Notes:
As I normally use Android Studio for developing I had to install and setup IntelliJ from scratch and had numerous issues with the initial setup, compiling. 
This meant that I was not able finish my Unit testing or Implement Spring MVC. I have however created the basic model keeping in mind the relevant
requirements.
